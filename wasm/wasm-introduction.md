# WASM Part I: What is WebAssembly? Reasons to take it seriously
This article is the beginning of a serie of two more posts that describes what is WebAssembly(WASM)
and the importance of this technology. On completion, the reader should understand the basic
concepts related to this topic.
### The traditional web
The majority of the web is running using the traditional architecture, by traditional we mean
a web browser sending requests to a server via http/s. This web browser uses HTML and CSS to render 
content and delegate to JavaScript the responsibility to manage the behaviour of these components and the
interaction between the browser and the server via request - response life cycle. That's it, plain
and simple. 
### So, this scenario is working at the moment. What is the problem?
The problems with the traditional web are the limitations of the browser as interpreter/compiler(Depending
on the technology impemented by the browser) and rendered at the same time. In general, the performance of
JavaScript running resource-intensive applications like video editors, 3D games, and son on, is far away to
compete with the native performance.
