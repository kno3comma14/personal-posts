# WASM PART II: Using Rust and ClojureScript
In the last [post](https://flexiana.com/2021/11/wasm-part-i-what-is-webassembly-reasons-to-take-it-seriously) we studied what is WebAssembly,
it's influence in the modern web development and we presented a simple demo using WAT to WASM compilation. 
In this post, we will sove a more complex problem using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to WASM compilation.

## WAT is not enough! 
TODO: General explanation why WAT is not enough for big applications.

## What is Rust? Why so much love is coming from the community?
TODO: Explain what is Rust and why the comunity is giving so much love to it.

## TiedUp!
TODO: Explain the TiedUp game, business rules and more

### ClojureScript - Presentation layer
TODO: present the code from the repository, how is structured and how to run

### Rust - Business layer
TODO: Present the code from the repository, how is structured and how to run it

### Integration - Business Layer <=> Presentation Layer
TODO: How to integrate both projects and how run the project

## Conclusion
TODO: Rephrase the whole article and give an approximation approach for future articles.
